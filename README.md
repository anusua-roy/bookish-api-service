# 📚 Bookish API Service

A backend API project inspired by **Goodreads**, built with **Node.js** and **Express**. This project aims to serve as the foundation for a full-stack app to manage books, reviews, user shelves, and reading progress.

---

## 🌟 Features (Planned)
- User authentication (JWT-based)
- CRUD operations for books, reviews, authors
- Search and filter capabilities
- User-defined reading shelves (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Read)
- Ratings and reviews per user/book
- Admin dashboard to manage book data

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- REST API (GraphQL considered for future)

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Later)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once ready, you’ll be able to access endpoints like:
```
GET    /api/books
POST   /api/books
POST   /api/reviews
GET    /api/users/:id/shelves
```
